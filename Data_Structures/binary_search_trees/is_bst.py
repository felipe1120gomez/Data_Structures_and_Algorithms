        Dictionary created with right values as key and indexes as value

    Methods
    -------
    read(self):
        Create a binary tree from the input lines.

    in_order(self):
        First the left node is added, then the root, and finally the right node.

    is_binary_search_tree(self):
        Checks if a binary tree is a binary search tree.
